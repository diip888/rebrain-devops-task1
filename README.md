# Repository description in README.md

The project __as if__ is a digital solution within the framework of the World AI&DATA Challenge, corresponding to the task <https://git.asi.ru/tasks/world-ai-and-data-challenge/>

## Getting Started __like__

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes. See *deployment* for notes on how to deploy the project on a live system.

### Prerequisites __like__

What things you need to install the software and how to install them:

```bash
uname -a # test you linux core
apt update
apt upgrade -y
```

### Installing __like__

A step by step series of examples that tell you how to get a development env running

```bash
mkdir pytest_project
cd pytest_project
python3 -m venv pytest-env
```

```bash
source pytest-env/bin/activate
pytest --pyargs mypkg
```

And repeat

```text
until finished
```

End with an example of getting some data out of the system or using it for a little demo

## Running the tests __like__

Explain how to run the automated tests for this system.
Test automation pyramid consists of three levels:

1. Unit Tests

    1.1 Subunit test

2. Integration Tests

3. End to end Tests

I didn't know how make automated tests. But i'll learn it to rebrain  <a  href="https://rebrainme.com" target="_blank">Rebrain </a> courses.

```python
def test_sum():
    assert sum([1, 2, 3]) == 6, "Should be 6"

if __name__ == "__main__":
    test_sum()
    print("Everything passed")
```

* [X] check

### Break down into end to end tests __like__

End to end testing (E2E testing) is a software testing method that involves testing an application‚Äôs workflow from beginning to end. This method aims to replicate real user scenarios to validate the system for integration and data integrity.

```python
Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "test_sum_2.py", line 9, in <module>
    test_sum_tuple()
  File "test_sum_2.py", line 5, in test_sum_tuple
    assert sum((1, 2, 2)) == 6, "Should be 6"
AssertionError: Should be 6
```

### And coding style tests __as is__

We will also write a test, test_capital_case to ensure that the function does what it says. We‚Äôll prefix our test function names with test_, since this is what pytest expects our test functions to be named.

```python
# test_capitalize.py

def capital_case(x):
    return x.capitalize()

def test_capital_case():
    assert capital_case('semaphore') == 'Semaphore'

```
